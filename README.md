# The Scraper

## If you are going to skid this, at least credit me in one way or another.

## General features:

- Token extract from all messages
- Combo scraper (works with bby, hazard, pirate and any other stealer just ask me I will add it)
- Webhook forwarder (unnukable)
- HazardV2 Zip file auto unpack
- PirateStealer Zip auto unpack
- bby cookie file auto convert

# Commands:

- /tokens : generates a list of scraped tokens, ordered newest first to oldest
- /combos : search grabbed combos. for example, `/combos netflix.com` will find all scraped Netflix combos
- /webhook : generates a private unnukable webhook that forwards to your own Discord webhook
- /timestamp : converts a Discord ID to a timestamp
- /role_config : allows you to add role pings for special cases like billing, boosts, nitro, HQ Guilds and more
- /agree : basically a joke command.
- /authorize : authorizes the guild to use the bot
- /deauthorize : deauthorizes the guild to use the bot

# Token checker features:

All of this data is stored in the db.
